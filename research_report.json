Given the audience's heavy reliance on social media, allocating budget to Google Ads and Meta platforms is crucial. Specifically, prioritizing Facebook and Instagram is recommended due to their robust targeting capabilities and ad format variety. By doing so, we can effectively reach our target audience and maximize advertising effectiveness.\n\nTo drive campaign success, it's essential to focus on targeted ad formats and timing. Allocating budget based on industry and campaign goals will ensure we're optimizing our spend and achieving our objectives. By leveraging the strengths of Facebook and Instagram, we can create a cohesive and impactful campaign that resonates with our target audience.
