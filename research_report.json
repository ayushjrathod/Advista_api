  "executive_summary": "As we launch the Canva Pro advertising campaign, our primary objective is to drive signups for the 30-day free trial and convert 10% of trialers into paid subscribers. To achieve this, we will focus on simplifying our communication to three core ideas about Canva Pro, targeting three key audience segments, and utilizing three main marketing channels. Our research reveals that small business owners, freelance marketers and designers, social media managers, content creators, and marketing teams are our primary targets, with a strong online presence and a preference for flexibility, control, and community.\n\nThe competitive landscape for Canva Pro is highly competitive, with key competitors including Adobe Express, Figma, VistaCreate, and PicMonkey. However, our research highlights Canva Pro's unique strength as an all-in-one design powerhouse, offering a wide range of professionally designed templates, premium features, and brand tools. To capitalize on this, we will prioritize Facebook and Instagram Ads, leveraging eye-catching visuals and targeted ad creative to drive signups for the 30-day free trial. By allocating a significant budget to these channels, we can effectively reach our target audience and achieve our campaign goals.\n\nTo optimize our campaign performance, we will adhere to the 40/40/20 rule, emphasizing the importance of finding the right audience and creating a compelling value proposition. Our messaging will be friendly, helpful, upbeat, and creative, with clear calls-to-action and visual examples. We will also monitor and optimize ad performance using Facebook's analytics tools, ensuring that our campaign is data-driven and agile. By concentrating our efforts on the most effective channels and messaging, we aim to boost landing page conversion by 15% in 3 months.\n\nTo achieve our campaign objectives, we recommend the following key actions: (1) prioritize Facebook and Instagram Ads, with a focus on targeted ad creative and eye-catching visuals; (2) simplify our communication to three core ideas about Canva Pro, emphasizing its unique strengths as an all-in-one design powerhouse; and (3) continuously monitor and optimize ad performance using Facebook's analytics tools. By following these recommendations and staying focused on our target audience and campaign goals, we are confident that we can drive signups for the 30-day free trial, convert trialers into paid subscribers, and increase brand awareness among small business owners.",
