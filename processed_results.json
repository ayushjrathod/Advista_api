Iconic campaigns with significant impact You can watch this video to learn about the impact of the Volkswagen \"Think Small\" campaign: \u2022 Launched in 1988, this slogan became inseparable from the brand by focusing on inspiration, self-belief, and the emotional connection to athletic performance. It is credited with helping to increase Nike's sales from under $1 billion to over $9 billion in a decade. \u2022 This campaign served as a powerful call to action and cemented Apple's brand identity around creativity and rebellion. It continues to be the core of their branding strategy. \u2022 This campaign personalized the brand by replacing the Coca-Cola logo with common names on bottles, encouraging consumers to find and share a bottle with their name on it. \u2022 Created in 1959, this campaign is considered one of the most influential of the 20th century, known for its simple, honest, and counter-cultural approach that resonated with the public. \u2022 This campaign successfully linked diamond rings to the idea of everlasting commitment and love.

It originates from the 1930s movie industry and serves as a reminder that multiple exposures across different channels are necessary for a consumer to remember and purchase a product or service. While the exact number seven is not a magic number, the principle holds that consistent and strategic repeated exposure is key to building awareness and driving sales. How it works \u2022 A potential customer must be exposed to a brand's message multiple times across different touchpoints before they are ready to buy. \u2022 The rule was first formulated by movie executives who discovered that a minimum of seven exposures were needed for an audience to commit to buying a movie ticket. \u2022 In the digital age, this means a consumer might see an ad on social media, visit the website, receive a retargeting ad on another site, read a blog post, and see a sponsored search result\u2014all contributing to the total number of exposures. \u2022 Repeated exposure can lead to increased familiarity and positive feelings toward a brand, a psychological phenomenon known as the \"mere-exposure effect\". Important considerations \u2022 While \"seven\" is a guideline, the quality and context of the message are crucial. Spamming the same irrelevant message repeatedly can alienate customers. \u2022 Instead of repeating the exact same ad, marketers use different formats (like social media posts, blog articles, videos, or email) across various channels to count towards the total exposures without causing fatigue. \u2022 Modern marketing leverages tools like data analytics and AI to optimize the timing and channels of communication, ensuring messages are frequent enough to be effective but not so frequent as to be overwhelming.",
