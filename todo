i understood scripts file.
now next understand other files.

things i think we can do till now:
[] use langchain-groq instead of groq sdk, but first see why ?
[] we create a query to search on youtube in scripts.py can we use it in reddit also ?
[] what more things we can do in user profile such as taking input of past ads they made to understand their style and pass it to llm as context.
[] check astra_db dashboard
